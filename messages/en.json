        "question": "What kind of questions can I ask?",
        "answer": "Tarot is best suited for exploring open-ended questions, such as \"What should I pay attention to in this relationship?\" rather than yes/no questions like \"Does he/she love me?\" The best questions focus on your own growth and direction for action."

      "q3": {
        "question": "How often can I do readings?",
        "answer": "It's recommended to wait at least a week before doing another reading on the same question. Frequent readings on the same topic may lead to more confusion rather than clear guidance."

        "question": "What's the difference between AI and human readings?",
        "answer": "AI readings are based on traditional tarot knowledge, providing objective and standardized interpretations. Human readings may incorporate the reader's personal experience and intuition. AI's advantages lie in immediacy, consistency, and accessibility."
